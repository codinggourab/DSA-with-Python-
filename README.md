# DSA with Python

Welcome to the **DSA with Python** repository! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to implementing various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Python. It is designed for beginners and experienced programmers who want to strengthen their problem-solving skills.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🏗 Data Structures
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues** (Simple, Circular, Priority)
- **Hash Tables**
- **Heaps** (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- **Graphs** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- **Trees** (Binary Tree, BST, AVL Tree, Trie, Segment Tree)

### ⚡ Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort)
- **Searching Algorithms** (Linear Search, Binary Search, Interpolation Search)
- **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm)
- **Dynamic Programming** (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, Fibonacci Sequence, Coin Change Problem, etc.)
- **Backtracking** (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Word Search)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (Huffman Coding, Activity Selection, Kruskal’s Algorithm)
